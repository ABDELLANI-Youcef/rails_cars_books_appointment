## About

In this application, I make a website to book appointments to try cars. The user can choose from a list of cars and fix a date and a city where to  try the car. If the user has the admin privelege he can also create, edit, and delete a car. The user logs in and signs up to the application using Jjson Web Token.

To build this application we used:


- Ruby on Rails;
- Active Storage;
- Cloudinary
- Postgresql database;
- Json Web Token (jwt);
- (bcrypt) to crypt password;
- Rspec to test the project;
- Linters ( Rubocop )

## How to use the application

In this Application, on the home page, the user gets the informations about the COVID-19 statistics (cases, deaths, and recoveries). The user can use the filter form to change the results to be shown. If the user wants to get more details about a specific country, he can click on the name of that country in order to access a page of details. There he finds the information about the country:
- the capital of the country;
- the population in the country;
- the number of confirmed cases;
- the number of deaths due to COVID-19;
- the number of recoveries from COVID-19;
- the increase in the number of cases in the last 30 days;
- the increase in the number of deaths in the last 30 days.
